# My-Projects

Hello there!

I am writing to introduce myself, Jefferson Bual, a recent recipient of a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Throughout the course of my academic journey, I have undertaken several notable projects that i already posted to my branches, two of which I would like to present for your consideration:

BayaScript: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Driven Character Recognition in a Mobile Application for Learning Baybayin:
This endeavor introduces "BayaScript," a mobile application developed to facilitate the learning of the Baybayin script. Employing a custom CNN model for character recognition, despite operating with a modest dataset, the application has demonstrated promising accuracies. This project underscores the potential for efficient script acquisition, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

A Web-Based Student Academic Performance Monitoring System for Banay-Banay Elementary School, acronymically referred to as SAPMS, has been meticulously crafted to afford teachers and parents the capability to remotely monitor the academic progress of students. Noteworthy features include the integration of the AES algorithm for data encryption, thereby ensuring user privacy, alongside the utilization of Bootstrap and PHP for its implementation. Moreover, as part of its robust functionality, the system incorporates SQL databases for efficient data manipulation. Additionally, it offers the convenient feature of exporting data into Excel format, facilitating easy data analysis for educators and administrators alike.

I am keen to discuss these projects further and explore potential opportunities for collaboration or contribution. Please do not hesitate to reach out should you require any additional information or wish to engage in further discourse regarding my work.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
