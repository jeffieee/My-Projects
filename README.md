BayaScript: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Driven Character Recognition in a Mobile Application for Learning Baybayin: This endeavor introduces "BayaScript," a mobile application developed to facilitate the learning of the Baybayin script. Employing a custom CNN model for character recognition, despite operating with a modest dataset, the application has demonstrated promising accuracies. This project underscores the potential for efficient script acquisition, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
